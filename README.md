# 🚚 **DataCo Smart Supply Chain Analysis (SQL + Power BI)**

## 🧠 Summary
A complete end-to-end analytics project using SQL and Power BI to optimize supply chain performance.
This case study explores profitability, logistics delays, discount impact and customer behavior across 180K+ sales records.

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Clean & model raw sales data into a star/snowflake schema using SQL (BigQuery)
- Perform data exploration to uncover insights on sales, shipping and customer behavior
- Build interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize KPIs and trends
- Generate actionable business recommendations through data storytelling

## 📈 Report Highlights
A 6-page Power BI report with actionable supply chain insights such as:

1. **`Overview:`**  
KPIs, revenue trends, best-selling categories
  
2. **`Time Intelligence:`**  
Seasonality, YoY growth, shipping performance
  
3. **`Customer & Product:`**  
Top customers, bundled purchases, segment behavior
  
4. **`Logistics:`**  
Late Deliveries by shipping mode, region, category
  
5. **`Profitability:`**  
Discounts, profit margin, negative-profit orders
  
6. **`Action Radar:`**  
Summary page with strategic calls-to-action

## 💡 Key Insights
- 🛑 **54.82%** or orders are late — but average delay is low **(~0.57 days)**
- 💰 Top 10 customers contribute just **0.25%** of total revenue → retention opportunity
- 🎯 Products with **high discounts** and **low profit** are hurting profitability
- 🧭 Regions like Pacific Asia have  slight higher delay rates and lower margins
- 📉 The Computers category has high revenue but is consistently unprofitable

## 🧭 Recommendations
- Improve delivery reliability _(First Class shipping → highest delay rate)_
- Review discounting strategies on loss-making products
- Expand strong product lines _(e.g. Fishing)_ and bundled sales strategies
- Focus marketing on moderate-growth regions _(Europe, Australia)_
